# Vinted API

Vinted API is a miniature-scale reproduction of the Vinted API to make my [Vinted replica work](https://nicolas-riera-vinted-training.netlify.app/). This API allows users to : create an account, log to this account, create an offer, update this offer (including uploading pictures), filter the offers and delete an offer.

Frontend project is here: üëâ [Frontend](https://github.com/nicoriera/training-vinted-frontend)
